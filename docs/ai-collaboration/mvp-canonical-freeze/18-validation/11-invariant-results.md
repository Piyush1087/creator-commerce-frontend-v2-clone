| ID | Result | Proof | Classification / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INV-01 | PASS (static/unit + postgres 10/10) | FE auth tests; BE `auth-security.static/unit`; `auth-security.postgres.test.ts` on `bs12_freeze_auth` | |
| INV-02 | PASS (I2 leftover closed) | Same `creator-entry.postgres.test.ts` 29/29 as INV-03 | Documented PARTIAL was the I2 harness ctor, not a new I1 fail |
| INV-03 | PASS architecture/smoke + postgres 29/29 | FE creator-entry; browser Brand↛Creator; `creator-entry.postgres.test.ts` Parent-run 2026-09-09 | Harness ctor now `(prisma, mail, scan, auth, googleAuth)` |
| INV-04 | PASS (unit + postgres 5/5) | C-05 policy + `creator-team.postgres.test.ts` on `c05_freeze_team` | |
| INV-05 | PASS (unit + smoke) | Shell tests + browser hide | Chat architecture test retargeted RUN 9 (no P6 git-diff) |
| INV-06 | **PASS** postgres (2026-09-09 retry) | Fresh `c03_p14_handoff` 34/34 serial `--testTimeout=30000` | Prior 5s timeouts + dirty-DB count drift were `ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED`, not product red |
| INV-07 | **PASS** postgres handoff; local seed leftover closed RUN 9 | Same suite: approval commits `Collaboration` | `scripts/seed-dev-collaboration.ts` now seeds a **legacy** brief-linked fixture (`source_application_id` null). Canonical handoff remains this suite |
| INV-08 | PARTIAL | C-05 P2 architecture | Brand Payouts v1 / C-06 out |
| INV-09 | PARTIAL | C-05 Settings contact/shipping unit+architecture PASS (BE 24/24 isolated; Parent reconfirm 2026-09-09 BE contact-phone 8/8 + FE 6/6). Brand Collab fulfillment does **not** read `CreatorShippingAddress`; it stores Brand-entered evidence. Collab `POST creator/shipping-address` is a second writer. C-05 P2 forbids Collaboration business deps. Cross-module *consumption* not proven; not a Brand Payouts pull. | Settings half proven; consumption not in tree |
| INV-10 | PARTIAL | Postmark fail + OTP still issued off-prod (postgres + smoke) | Live IG/Razorpay NOT_RUN |
| INV-11 | PARTIAL | Browser Brand Home fail-closed for Creator | |
| INV-12 | PASS (unit + postgres 11/11 + browser) | `brand-workspace-authorization.postgres.test.ts` on `bs07_freeze_auth` | |
| INV-13 | FAIL classified; **Parent-accepted 2026-09-09** later amendment | Same duplicate tables on C-03 accepted `aebeb85`, origin `development` `cd446fb`, freeze. Canonical C-03 writes `Collaboration`; UCE pipeline leftover. Bank/payout models vs C-05 destinations + C-06/Payouts not pulled. **No Prisma drop this freeze.** | `PREEXISTING_ACCEPTED_DEBT` (was `UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_REVIEW`) |
